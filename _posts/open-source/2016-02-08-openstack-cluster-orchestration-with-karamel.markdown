This is a special post as it remarks my first contribution to a small open-source project and also to my ex-colleagues 
during my brief time at [SICS](https://www.sics.se/). This project main core work continues based on the initial 
prototype my Master Thesis was centered on orchestrating Hadoop with Platform as a Service.
 
Of course, 4 years have nearly passed since that very early prototype, and the idea has evolved into a more mature project 
 called Karamel inside SICS.
