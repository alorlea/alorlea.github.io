Like the boom of Big data roughly around 2010, where it started to become
a key part of every new modern business in order to understand theirs 
customer needs, growth of your business and insight; we can all agree, 
that we are living a new trend on distributed computing.
 
At that time, we counted with the wide adoption of data processing frameworks
based on Google's interpretation of [Map Reduce](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html) 
like Hadoop Distributed File System **HDFS** with Map Reduce. This lead to
an interest to go further and new frameworks came to exist like Yet Another Resource Manager **YARN**
or newer frameworks like Apache Flink and Apache Spark

Since Docker's initial release in 2013 and after 2 years since its release;
 we could experience a sudden new way on how we will develop distributed applications.
A very hot topic and architecture that is gaining a lot of acceptance in large
acceptance is the definition of a Microservice architecture.
