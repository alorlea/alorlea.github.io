<p style="text-align:justify;">Another year is starting to come to its end in a few months and as usually, another edition of IEEExtreme is starting. This is a special date for all computer science geeks around the IEEE Student Branches as we have the opportunity to improve our coding skills with this competition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Teams are formed by 3 members were they need to collaborate and solve together the different challenges that will be posted during the 24 hour schedule of this competition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we are a few hours before the start of the 6th edition of the competition (20th October at 00:00 UTC time) and its time to warm up those coding skills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although actually I am living in Stockholm finishing my master studies at KTH (there is actually a IEEE Student Branch where you can attend the IEEExtreme). For this occasion, I decided to take a plane back to Madrid to attend this 6th Edition in the Student Branch of my home university so I could compete once again with my fellow partners of my Student Branch. Also it was a great time to visit some friends from Madrid and see my family once again. Last year I was unlucky to not attend the 5th Edition and missed that experience with my friends, this time I made sure it didn't happen again, as probably this will be my last time attending this activity offered by the IEEE.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In previous editions I was unlucky to solve some problems during the competition, so I decided to make the effort to train myself and improve my theoretical background in computer algorithms. I hope that this time, it makes a difference when solving the challenges we will probably face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For now, time to relax before the competition and good luck to all the teams attending this edition.</p>
