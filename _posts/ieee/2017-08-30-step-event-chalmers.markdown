Building a healthy and successful career in any technical field of engineer or
even in software is tough. There has been a huge increase of fields that depend
on Software nowadays. Cloud computing, machine learning, deep learning, data science,
etc.. Keeping track of all this areas, can be an insane amount of information to follow.

## Building your career takes time

With this large spectrum of disciplines, technologies and concepts; for a complete youngster
starting their careers can lead to confusion, frustration on how to define your path
and even raise the question of "__What the *** am I doing with my life?__"
Basically, you are starting your career and you have a hard time to figure out how you will see yourself in 20 years.

If you add to the mix, the feeling that you are looking for a job in a
field you are passionate and get rejected multiple times and even sometimes come
close to the prize after doing hard effort; it can really demoralize you.

That is why, more than ever; it becomes important that you look into how you want
to build your career early on as the only responsible person behind it will be you 90% of
the time, unless you work in a big high tech corporation like Google or Spotify; companies
that have enough resources to focus on employee satisfaction.

This last 20th of June, as part of an IEEE YP sponsored activity under the STEP
program; I decided to take the lead and organise a small workshop around career
development based on my experience after nearly 4 years out of my studies since
2013.

## Career Development, Why defining your early career matters

The goal when preparing this workshop, was to increase the awareness among students on what a big transition is when you do the transition from graduate school to your
first job and enter the job market. Technical schools are very good at preparing their students to tackle problems in their fields, but when it comes to working in a company both in startups & enterprise or as part of a team, they need to start developing a set of skills which are becoming vital day by day.

Grades and being success in the classroom, does not exactly correlate that you will
be the successful in the long run in the real world. People who are capable of
developing soft skills, personal skills and social skills, Emotional Coefficient
(EQ); are becoming more attractive to employers these days. It is important to
develop a correct balance with the classic Intellectual Coefficient (IQ).
Additionally, a career is like a marathon, if you do not train and prepare for the
long run; it could probably not end the way you wanted to develop as a professional.

## Reception of the event

The workshop was praised and received with positive outcome by the attendees, as the material presented did not correspond to the common tips someone can get access to and fail to link with today's markets.

The workshop material covered concepts related to key areas which included:
* Developing soft skills for effective communication
* Understanding someone's limits by understanding the effective development zone between the comfort zone and the stressful zone.
* The importance of taking measurable risks to develop oneself further.

In addition, tips were given regarding how you could develop personal development
plans in a simple way & how to iterate over them to get all its potential from it.

## Speaker's motivation

Probably 4 years, could not seem a lot of time, but as Albert Einstein defines in
his relativity theory; time is relative and here the key question is __What have
you done in those 4 years?__

In my case, I still remember my experience of landing a secure and fulfilling job after my studies. Not only this, but Additionally I also encounter frustrations on
how my career should progress in an industry which requires you to stay sharp on
your skills.

In those 4 years basically I made more mistakes than in my whole time at engineering school. This translates into basically, each time I failed; I took the time to really think about it and take a plan of action of what needs to change to reach where I want in my career.

So through, that process; I did a reading of my own and search over multiples
resources on personal development to understand what needs to be done, what are
my motivations and what pushes me to develop. This way, you can feel you reach a state in your life where you are on control of your career.
